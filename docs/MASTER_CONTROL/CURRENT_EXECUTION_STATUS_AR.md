| 0 — Master Control & Safe Delivery | CLOSED ✅ | ابدأ Plan 1 |
| 1 — Repository Reconciliation | CLOSED ✅ | voice gap + R2 tooling reconciled |
| 2 — Production Closure | IN PROGRESS ⚠️ | runtime/performance/network green; DR runtime staging fix in #281 |
| 3 — Speed/Bandwidth | WAITING | #268 |
| 4 — Data Model/Storage | WAITING FOR DR | بعد Plan 2 baseline |
| 5 — Residual Architecture | WAITING | auth/App/quiz/store residuals |
| 6 — Student Journey Certification | MOSTLY MERGED | regression after structural/data changes |
| 7 — AI Live Certification | PROVIDER PENDING | real quota/cost/failover proof |
| 8 — Question Bank Integrity | DOMAIN ACTIVE | #264 + FND26/COL2627 |
| 9 — Market Readiness | BLOCKED | requires 1–8 exit gates |

## PLAN 0 evidence

### GitHub
Ruleset: `Protect main`
- enforcement: active.
- target: default branch/main.
- pull request required.
- force push blocked.
- deletion blocked.
- bypass list empty.
- required checks:
  1. `Auth + RBAC + assessments + courses + commerce on isolated Mongo`
  2. `Full-stack roles + CRUD + school + quiz flows on isolated Mongo`
  3. `Cross-phase + handover regression`

### Vercel
- Preview Branch Tracking disabled for unassigned/non-main work branches.
- Production Branch remains `main`.
- verification commit: `ab30963e0fd9e45e94bed31bd24499e107e609ad`.
- deployment records for that verification window: **0**.

## PLAN 1 closure

- PR #260 gap: minimal teacher voice playback reapplied inside `ReviewSession`; STT/TTS/Smart Tutor/session isolation preserved.
- R2 V2 audit tooling: clean-reapplied as manual reachability evidence; it does not authorize image linking and #264 remains visual truth.
- Reconciliation evidence: `docs/MASTER_CONTROL/PLAN_1_RECONCILIATION_EVIDENCE_AR.md`.
- No stale branch was merged wholesale.

**NEXT:** PLAN 2 — Production Closure / Runtime / DR / Governance.

## PLAN 2 current state

- Managed Redis: **LIVE PASS** — rate-limit + queue + realtime + scheduler; `scale-ready=200`.
- Google OAuth start: **LIVE PASS** — Google redirect + canonical Render callback.
- Sentry: **LIVE PASS** — latest event `a32f9e20f795473ea79116cbbc5b8176`.
- R2: **LIVE PASS** — presign/PUT/public-GET/SHA-256 proof completed.
- DR: **IN PROGRESS — RUNTIME NETWORK FIX** — the five source values are configured. Run `36320284837` proved a GitHub-hosted runner cannot reach Atlas after allowlist hardening; PR #281 moves only `mongodump` to a Frankfurt Render staging job while GitHub keeps the independent Artifact + isolated Mongo/MinIO restore certification. No runtime success is claimed yet.
- Frankfurt Atlas recovery: **NOT A FULL RESTORE** — do not cut over.
- Performance: **CLOSED ✅** — authenticated c=10/25/50, 340 GETs, 0% errors; material latency reduction satisfies #236 alternate exit path. Frankfurt↔Singapore remains optimization debt, not a PLAN 2 blocker.
- GitHub governance: closed.
- Atlas network: **CLOSED ✅** — `0.0.0.0/0` removed; current Render Frankfurt outbound `74.220.51.0/24` + `74.220.59.0/24` passed a fresh-process Mongo reconnect.
- Evidence: `docs/MASTER_CONTROL/PLAN_2_PRODUCTION_CLOSURE_EVIDENCE_AR.md`.

**PLAN 2 is not CLOSED yet. PLAN 3 must wait.**

## Open operational/domain issues

- #234 runtime integrations — CLOSED ✅.
- #235 disaster recovery.
- #236 topology/capacity — CLOSED ✅.
- #237 governance/network — CLOSED ✅.
- #264 question visual integrity.
- #268 residual performance/runtime footprint.

## Baseline at PLAN 0 creation

`main@e60a8f563dd406098378df70857423455739ef7a`

Git HEAD always overrides this historical baseline.

## BIO26 operational lane — 2026-10-06

- Scope: الأحياء فقط، batch `TAH-BIO-BIO26-FULL-V1`.
- Content gates: source/crop/dedupe/answers/taxonomy PASS; canonical **2,832**; taxonomy **29/98**.
- AI context: **2,832/2,832**, **48/48** lessons, pending=0; source-answer/skill-range/required-fields all PASS.
- Production plumbing: PR #388 merged; dedicated subject `sub_tah_biology_bio26`; legacy `علم البيئة` remains protected.
- Recovery package V3 audit: 2,832 items/images and self-hashes valid, but image bytes/geometry drift from frozen V2 and all `optionTexts` are bare A/B/C/D placeholders; production use rejected.
- Hardening branch: `ops/bio26-production-ready-hardening-2026-10-06` from `main@ac03c73b72c9bd20bd72becd047f66932b237307`.
- Importer and post-import verifier now fail closed on placeholder option text labels.
- Current gate: qualified READY package + R2 remote verification. Dry Run/Canary/Full/Integrity/Live E2E/Approval remain not run.
- Closure rule: do not mark BIO26 CLOSED before all production gates and live learner journey pass.
