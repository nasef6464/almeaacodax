## PLAN 0 evidence

### GitHub
Ruleset: `Protect main`
- enforcement: active.
- target: default branch/main.
- pull request required.
- force push blocked.
- deletion blocked.
- bypass list empty.
- required checks:
  1. `Auth + RBAC + assessments + courses + commerce on isolated Mongo`
  2. `Full-stack roles + CRUD + school + quiz flows on isolated Mongo`
  3. `Cross-phase + handover regression`

### Vercel
- Preview Branch Tracking disabled for unassigned/non-main work branches.
- Production Branch remains `main`.
- verification commit: `ab30963e0fd9e45e94bed31bd24499e107e609ad`.
- deployment records for that verification window: **0**.

## PLAN 1 closure

- PR #260 gap: minimal teacher voice playback reapplied inside `ReviewSession`; STT/TTS/Smart Tutor/session isolation preserved.
- R2 V2 audit tooling: clean-reapplied as manual reachability evidence; it does not authorize image linking and #264 remains visual truth.
- Reconciliation evidence: `docs/MASTER_CONTROL/PLAN_1_RECONCILIATION_EVIDENCE_AR.md`.
- No stale branch was merged wholesale.

**NEXT:** PLAN 2 — Production Closure / Runtime / DR / Governance.

## PLAN 2 current state

- Managed Redis: **LIVE PASS** — rate-limit + queue + realtime + scheduler; `scale-ready=200`.
- Google OAuth start: **LIVE PASS** — Google redirect + canonical Render callback.
- Sentry: **LIVE PASS** — latest event `a32f9e20f795473ea79116cbbc5b8176`.
- R2: **LIVE PASS** — presign/PUT/public-GET/SHA-256 proof completed.
- DR: **IN PROGRESS — RUNTIME NETWORK FIX** — the five source values are configured. Run `36320284837` proved a GitHub-hosted runner cannot reach Atlas after allowlist hardening; PR #281 moves only `mongodump` to a Frankfurt Render staging job while GitHub keeps the independent Artifact + isolated Mongo/MinIO restore certification. No runtime success is claimed yet.
- Frankfurt Atlas recovery: **NOT A FULL RESTORE** — do not cut over.
- Performance: **CLOSED ✅** — authenticated c=10/25/50, 340 GETs, 0% errors; material latency reduction satisfies #236 alternate exit path. Frankfurt↔Singapore remains optimization debt, not a PLAN 2 blocker.
- GitHub governance: closed.
- Atlas network: **CLOSED ✅** — `0.0.0.0/0` removed; current Render Frankfurt outbound `74.220.51.0/24` + `74.220.59.0/24` passed a fresh-process Mongo reconnect.
- Evidence: `docs/MASTER_CONTROL/PLAN_2_PRODUCTION_CLOSURE_EVIDENCE_AR.md`.

**PLAN 2 is not CLOSED yet. PLAN 3 must wait.**

## Open operational/domain issues

- #234 runtime integrations — CLOSED ✅.
- #235 disaster recovery.
- #236 topology/capacity — CLOSED ✅.
- #237 governance/network — CLOSED ✅.
- #264 question visual integrity.
- #268 residual performance/runtime footprint.

## Baseline at PLAN 0 creation

`main@e60a8f563dd406098378df70857423455739ef7a`

Git HEAD always overrides this historical baseline.

## BIO26 operational lane — CLOSED ✅ — 2026-10-07

- Scope: الأحياء فقط، batch `TAH-BIO-BIO26-FULL-V1`.
- Canonical production bank: **2,832/2,832 approved**; aliases excluded: **3/3**.

- Package: `BIO26_FINAL_ASSETS_V3_READY_2832.zip`, bytes **30,690,582**, SHA-256 `e2063da82250395c8e7f9c50a6cbba34269d9c6683c7db91a0ea9a92a494fa8f`.
- R2 authenticated verification: **PASS 2,832/2,832** (`BIO26_R2_VERIFIED_PASS`).
- Dry Run: **PASS 2,832/2,832**, live image samples **30**.
- Canary: **PASS 5/5 drafts**.
- Full Draft Import: **PASS 2,832/2,832**, live image samples **30**.
- Integrity audit: **PASS** — 2,832 unique codes/sourceItemIds/image hashes, 29/98 coverage, **0** scope/taxonomy/content/identity errors, **0** linked quizzes.
- Provenance persistence defect discovered pre-approval and fixed in PR **#433**; targeted draft-only backfill restored `aiContext.optionTextsSource=SOURCE_PDF` + `optionTextsVerified=true` for **2,832/2,832**.
- PR #433 merged as `7b07579b4aa68c46562ac451711328a06ab055ee`; exact-head gates PASS including BIO26 closure contract.
- Live E2E before approval: learner hidden **PASS**, live image samples **30**.
- Approval: **PASS 2,832/2,832** by dedicated atomic BIO26 closure gate.
- Live E2E after approval: learner-visible **PASS**, answer/provenance leak **0**, live image samples **30**.
- Post-Approval Audit: **PASS 2,832**, 29/98, linked quizzes **0**.
- Learning structure subsequently merged:
  - PR #437: **29 main topics / 98 subtopics**, subskill foundation drills, main-skill training, first five free, and **71** standard all-bank tests.
  - PR #439/current main: **49** main-skill training drills after split policy for high-volume skills.
  - 71 standard tests consume all **2,832** approved questions exactly once (**63×40 + 8×39 = 2,832**).
- Current production Render deploy: `main@2885b2b30eff2f959fdad3a0c098a2bd461f1b73`.
- **BIO26 CLOSED ✅** — no remaining production-import, integrity, Live E2E, approval, or post-approval gate.

**BIO26 must not be reopened unless a new source/content revision is explicitly requested.**
