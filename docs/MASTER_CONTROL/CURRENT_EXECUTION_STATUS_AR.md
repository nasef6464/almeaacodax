## PLAN 0 evidence

### GitHub
Ruleset: `Protect main`
- enforcement: active.
- target: default branch/main.
- pull request required.
- force push blocked.
- deletion blocked.
- bypass list empty.
- required checks:
  1. `Auth + RBAC + assessments + courses + commerce on isolated Mongo`
  2. `Full-stack roles + CRUD + school + quiz flows on isolated Mongo`
  3. `Cross-phase + handover regression`

### Vercel
- Preview Branch Tracking disabled for unassigned/non-main work branches.
- Production Branch remains `main`.
- verification commit: `ab30963e0fd9e45e94bed31bd24499e107e609ad`.
- deployment records for that verification window: **0**.

## PLAN 1 closure

- PR #260 gap: minimal teacher voice playback reapplied inside `ReviewSession`; STT/TTS/Smart Tutor/session isolation preserved.
- R2 V2 audit tooling: clean-reapplied as manual reachability evidence; it does not authorize image linking and #264 remains visual truth.
- Reconciliation evidence: `docs/MASTER_CONTROL/PLAN_1_RECONCILIATION_EVIDENCE_AR.md`.
- No stale branch was merged wholesale.

**NEXT:** PLAN 2 — Production Closure / Runtime / DR / Governance.

## Open operational/domain issues

- #234 runtime integrations.
- #235 disaster recovery.
- #236 topology/capacity.
- #237 remaining governance/network.
- #264 question visual integrity.
- #268 residual performance/runtime footprint.

Git HEAD always overrides this historical baseline.
